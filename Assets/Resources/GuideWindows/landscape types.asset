  Text: There are different types of terrain in the game. They can be identified
    by the shape of the region's stroke. Rectangular dotted line - walk, this type
    has no movement penalty. Long rounded line - swimming, here your units will move
    more slowly. Round dots - climbing, just like swimming your units will move slower.
    You can increase your movement speed on any terrain with upgrade cards.
