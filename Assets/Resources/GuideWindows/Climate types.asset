  title: Climate types
  Text: The game has cells with different types of climate. The climate can be recognized
    from the region's stroke color. White - temperate climate, Orange - heat, Blue
    - cold, Green - poison. On all non-temperate tiles, your units will gradually
    die from the weather. Increase elemental resistances with evolution cards to
    counter it.
