  title: Regions and nests
  Text: The level map is represented by regions, they are outlined by a line. Try
    to capture the entire region. If you have captured all the tiles in a region
    you will see a green marker offering to build a nest in that region, click on
    it, then click on the tile you want to build a nest on to do so.
